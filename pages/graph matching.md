- process of evaluating (dis)similarity of two graphs
	- find correspondence between nodes and edges (more generally: substructures) of two graphs that satisfies some constraints
	- in other words: find mapping between common substructures of two graphs
- not the same as [[graph comparison]] as graph matching yields matching (i.e., a mapping) and not a similarity measure
- taxonomy
	- by precision
		- exact graph matching
			- mapping between vertices of graphs that preserves edge structure and labeling
			- variants
				- constraints on edge structure must hold in one direction vs. must hold in both directions
		- inexact graph matching (or error-tolerant graph matching)
- pattern recognition techniques based on graph matchings
	- [[k-nearest neighbor classifier]]
- variants (from strictest to most relaxed)
	- equality in structure and labels of two graphs: [[graph isomorphism]]
	- equality in structure and labels of one graph with a subgraph: [[subgraph isomorphism]]
	- equality in structure and labels of subgraphs of two graphs: [[maximum common subgraph]]
- "error-tolerant variants"
	- strictly speaking not variants of graph matching as they produce a distance measure, not a matching of structural elements
	- [[graph edit distance]]
	- [[spectral graph matching]]

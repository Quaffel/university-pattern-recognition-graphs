- common subgraph isomorphism (CSI) kernel
	- counts the number of isomorphisms between subgraphs of $g_1$ and $g_2$
	- set of nodes forms a clique in association graph if there is a corresponding common subgraph isomorphism
		- counting all cliques in association graph yields number of common subgraph isomorphisms
- alternative kernels
	- count number of isomorphic subgraphs
		- not identical to CSI: there might be more than one isomorphism between a pair of isomorphic subgraphs

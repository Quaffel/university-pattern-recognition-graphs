- generative vs. discriminative
	- generative classification
		- $\theta$ is based on estimated class-conditioned feature distribution
		- allows to generate new samples (based on inferred distribution)
			- typically relies on inference of probability density function
	- discriminative classification
		- $\theta$ is based on class boundaries
		- may be more accurate if underlying distribution is hard to estimate
- classification with rejection
	- classification method is given the option to reject a classification in case of uncertainty
		- e.g., threshold-based classification mechanisms may define a "rejection range", typically close to the original (discrimination) threshold

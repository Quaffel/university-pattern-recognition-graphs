- motivation
	- [[random walk graph kernel]]s or rather the underlying [[direct product graph]]s only consider pairs of vertices in $g$ and $g'$ with identical label
		- vertices with similar but unequal labels are not considered
	- problematic when dealing with continuous label values
- similar to [[random walk graph kernel]] but uses [[modified direct product graph]]s rather than regular [[direct product graph]]s

- embeddings are functions that map elements of some family of objects to real vector spaces
- applications
	- allows application of operators proper to real vector spaces on those objects
		- spans gap between structural and statistical [[pattern recognition]]
	- can be used to reduce dimensionality of problem if family of objects is highly dimensional
- vectors should be representative of original object
	- representation should retain (select) properties
- variants
	- [[graph embedding]]
	- [[node embedding]]

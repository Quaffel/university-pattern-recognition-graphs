- pattern recognition tasks on graphs
	- graph level
		- graph classification: predict a discrete or continuous property of an entire graph
			- application: predict molecule property
		- graph generation: generating new graphs from existing graphs
			- application: generate new molecules
	- subgraph level
		- frequent subgraph detection
			- application: pattern in ASTs
		- community detection (node clustering): identify group of densely interconnected nodes within a graph
			- application: social communities in social networks
	- node level
		- node classification: predict a discrete or continuous property of a node (based on the graph's properties, notably the node's neighborhood)
			- application: categorize transaction nodes in payment network
		- node embedding
			- application: downstream machine learning tasks
		- centrality computation: find important nodes in graph
			- application: influential hubs in traffic networks
	- edge level
		- link prediction: predict the existence (and properties) of a relationship between nodes
			- application: fill in gaps in knowledge graph

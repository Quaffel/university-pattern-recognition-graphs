- similarity measures
	- graph edit distance
		- measure of required distortion to transform one graph into another
			- can be applied to any two graphs
			- analogous to levenshtein distance
	- tree edit distance
		- more efficient to compute
	- spectral analysis
		- eigen decomposition of adjacency (and some other) matrix
- graph embedding
	- scalar embeddings: polarity number, wiener index
	- spectral embedding
- graph kernels
	- original way: first calculate embedding, then calculate dot product
	- kernel machine is a shortcut to perform both operations at once ("operator fusion")
	- many problems can be reformulated in terms of dot products
		- for example: Support Vector Machines
		- allows application of those methods to graphs as well
- graph clustering
	- find strongly connected subgraphs within a larger graph, which is only loosely connected to the rest of the graph
- graph neural networks
	- how to pass graphs to neural network? ("interface" of neural networks doesn't match)
		- use of graph-specific convolutions
	- can be used to learn graph embeddings
- frequent subgraph and motif detection

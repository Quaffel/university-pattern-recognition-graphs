- motivation
	- normalize by the expected number of common neighbors in the graph
		- probabilistic approach
- idea
	- Suppose nodes $u_i$ and $u_j$ have degrees $\deg (u_i) = k_i$ and $\deg (u_j) = k_j$, respectively. How many common neighbors should we expect them to have?
		- we randomly choose $k_i$ neighbors for $u_i$ and $k_j$ neighbors for $u_j$
		- for every neighbor that we choose for $u_i$, we choose a neighbor of $u_j$ with probability $\frac{k_j}{N}$
		- expected number of common neighbors is $k_i \bullet \frac{k_j}{N}$
	- not directly to the expectation of a random variable (term "expectation" is avoided here)
- properties
	- value range
		- between $-1$ and $1$
		- coefficient of $0$ indicates that number of common neighbors of $u_i$ and $u_j$ matches the expectation
		- negative coefficient indicates that the number of common neighbors of $u_i$ and $u_j$ is lower than the expectation
		- positive coefficient indicates that the number of common neighbors of $u_i$ and $u_j$ is higher than the expectation
